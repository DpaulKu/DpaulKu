- 👋 Hi, I’m @DpaulKu
- 👀 I’m interested in audio file editing of field recordings I've made.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about UVR 5 and its ability to separate typical stems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any UVR processing models that deal with non-musical content.
- 📫 Please reach me here first if possible... 'still learning the layout here!
- 😄 Pronouns: The/She/It
- ⚡ Fun fact: It takes a big dog to weight a ton.
